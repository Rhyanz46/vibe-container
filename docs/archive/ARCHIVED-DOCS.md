## Why Were These Archived?

These documents were archived because:
1. The setup guides are mostly for specific edge cases or older configurations
2. Troubleshooting guides for issues that have been resolved in the current version
3. To keep the root directory clean and focused on core documentation
4. Deployment guides are less commonly needed and better kept in archive
